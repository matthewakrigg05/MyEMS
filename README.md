# MyEMS

The repository for this project is a new version of an old repository that I had made, there were a series of issues that 
arose when working in that repository, so I thought the best thing for me to do was to delete it and re-upload a safer version.

This is my current project that I am working on in my free time. My intentions with this project are to teach myself and 
better understand OOP principles and to prepare me for another project that I plan on undertaking soon as part of research 
club at University. Another of my project intentions is to build something that could, in theory, be used, perhaps by smaller
businesses like a restaurant; inspired by my own part-time work in a restaurant. I plan to make a system that would replace 
something like an Excel spreadsheet, as well as something that is capable of filling out payslips each month as well as 
logging hours. Potentially I would do this with admin/manager accounts and then staff accounts so that the staff can log
their hours themselves, but I am yet to decide. I look forward to putting more on here and completing items on the checklist 
below of features. *? In the to do list indicate features that I may add in the future, not in the initial building.

- [ ] - Add and remove employees + info
- [ ] - Calculate pay each month/biweekly/weekly?
- [ ] - Generate Pay-Slips?
- [ ] - Ability to log hours
- [ ] - Generate Rotas
